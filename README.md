# CPCDS Authorization Server

This project is the authorization server for the [CPCDS Reference Server](https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-server-ri). It supports authorization using OAuth 2.0 in the stand alone SMART app launch sequence.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get the server up and running is by pulling the built image from docker hub.

```bash
docker pull blangley/cpcds-auth-server
docker run -p 8180:8180 blangley/cpcds-auth-server
```

This will deploy the authorization server to http://localhost:8180.

## Building locally with Docker

To start the server simply build and run using docker. The container will automatically build and deploy using a tomcat server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-auth-server.git
cd cpcds-auth-server
docker build -t cpcds-auth-server .
docker run -p 8180:8180 cpcds-auth-server
```

This will build and deploy the authorization server to http://localhost:8180.

## Manual Build and Run

Clone the repo and build the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-auth-server.git
cd cpcds-auth-server
./gradlew installBootDist
./gradlew bootRun
```

This will build and deploy the authorization server to http://localhost:8180.

Note: This has only been tested using Java 11.

## Authorization & Launch Sequence

### GET /authorization

The first step is to obtain an authorization code from the auth server. The endpoint for this is `/authorization` and the query parameters are:
| Parameter | Value |
| ----------|-------|
| `response_type` | `code` |
| `client_id` | The patient identifier |
| `redirect_uri` | The URI to redirect to with the code |
| `scope` | The [SMART on FHIR Access Scope](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context/index.html) |
| `state` | Unique ID generated by the client for this interaction
| `aud` | The base URL for the CPCDS FHIR server (`http://localhost:8080/cpcds-server/fhir`)

Example:

```
GET http://localhost:8180/authorization?response_type=code&
      client_id=689&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/index&
      scope=patient/*.read&state=12345abc&aud=http://localhost:8180
```

The response to the GET request is a redirection to the provided `redirect_uri` with the following query parameters:
| Parameter | On | Value |
| ----------- | ----| ---- |
| `code` | Success | The authorization code for the client
| `state` | Success | Echo of `state` parameter in the request
| `error` | Failure | Error code defined in [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)

Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: http://localhost:3000/index?code=abc123&state=12345abc
```

Note: The authorization code is only valid for 2 minutes.

### POST /token

After obtaining an authorization code it is exchanged for an access token. To obtain an access token (which is valid for 1 hour) use the `/token` endpoint with the following query parameters:
| Parameter | Value |
| ----- | --- |
| `grant_type` | `authorization_code` |
| `code` | The authorization code returned by the `/authorization` endpoint |
| `redirect_uri` | The same `redirect_uri` from the `/authorization` request

The client must also include a basic Authorization header with the value `base64Encode(client_id:client_secret)` and use `Content-Type` of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

Example:

```
POST HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic MTpwYXNzd29yZA==
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
http://localhost:8180/token?grant_type=authorization_code&
      code=abc123&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/index
```

The response to the POST is a JSON object with the following values:
| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `access_token` | The access token for the protected resource |
| `token_type` | `bearer` |
| `expires_in` | The seconds until expiration (`3600`)

The `access_token` is valid for 1 hour and can be used to query protected resources from the CPCDS Server. For more details on how to use the CPCDS Server view the [README](https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-server-ri).
