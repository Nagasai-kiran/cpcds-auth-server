# CPCDS Authorization Server

This project is the authorization server for the [CPCDS Reference Server](https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-server-ri). It supports authorization using OAuth 2.0 in the stand alone SMART app launch sequence.

## Quickstart

The quickest way to get the server up and running is by pulling the built image from docker hub.

```bash
docker pull blangley/cpcds-auth-server
docker run -p 8180:8180 blangley/cpcds-auth-server
```

This will deploy the authorization server to http://localhost:8180.

Note: This image includes a copy of the database with preloaded users
| ID | Username | Password |
|----|----------|----------|
| 1 | user1 | password1|
| 689 | user689 | password689 |
| admin | admin | 123456789

## Building locally with Docker

To start the server simply build and run using docker. The container will automatically build and deploy using a tomcat server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-auth-server.git
cd cpcds-auth-server
docker build -t cpcds-auth-server .
docker run -p 8180:8180 cpcds-auth-server
```

This will build and deploy the authorization server to http://localhost:8180.

## Manual Build and Run

Clone the repo and build the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-auth-server.git
cd cpcds-auth-server
./gradlew installBootDist
./gradlew bootRun
```

This will build and deploy the authorization server to http://localhost:8180.

Note: This has only been tested using Java 11.

## Authorization & Launch Sequence

### POST /register/user

Before the authorization sequence can begin the user must register with the system. The endpoint for this is `/register/user` and the JSON body parameters are:
| Parameter | Value |
| ----------|-------|
| `username`| User created unique identifier for the system |
| `password`| User created password to authenticate |
| `id` | The id of the patient associated with this user

Example:

```
POST HTTP/1.1
http://localhost:8180/register/user
Content-Type: application/json
{
      "username": "user1",
      "password": "password1",
      "patientId": "1"
}
```

The response to the POST is 201 CREATED on success.

### GET /authorization

The first step is to obtain an authorization code from the auth server. The endpoint for this is `/authorization` and the query parameters are:
| Parameter | Value |
| ----------|-------|
| `response_type` | `code` |
| `client_id` | The client id |
| `redirect_uri` | The URI to redirect to with the code |
| `scope` | The [SMART on FHIR Access Scope](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/scopes-and-launch-context/index.html) |
| `state` | Unique ID generated by the client for this interaction
| `aud` | The base URL for the CPCDS FHIR server (`http://localhost:8080/cpcds-server/fhir`)

The server currently only defines one client with clientID `0oa41ji88gUjAKHiE4x6` and clientSecret `jR76UPXp6Q1cg6fM`.

Example:

```
GET http://localhost:8180/authorization?response_type=code&
      client_id=user689&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/index&
      scope=patient/*.read&state=12345abc&aud=http://localhost:8180
```

The response to the GET request is a redirection to the provided `redirect_uri` with the following query parameters:
| Parameter | On | Value |
| ----------- | ----| ---- |
| `code` | Success | The authorization code for the client
| `state` | Success | Echo of `state` parameter in the request
| `error` | Failure | Error code defined in [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)

Example:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: http://localhost:3000/index?code=abc123&state=12345abc
```

Note: The authorization code is only valid for 2 minutes.

### POST /token

After obtaining an authorization code it is exchanged for an access token. To obtain an access token (which is valid for 1 hour) use the `/token` endpoint with the following query parameters:
| Parameter | Value |
| ----- | --- |
| `grant_type` | `authorization_code` |
| `code` | The authorization code returned by the `/authorization` endpoint |
| `redirect_uri` | The same `redirect_uri` from the `/authorization` request

The client must also include a basic Authorization header with the value `base64Encode(client_id:client_secret)` and use `Content-Type` of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

The server currently only defines one client with clientID `0oa41ji88gUjAKHiE4x6` and clientSecret `jR76UPXp6Q1cg6fM`.

Example:

```
POST HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Basic MTpwYXNzd29yZA==
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
http://localhost:8180/token?grant_type=authorization_code&
      code=abc123&redirect_uri=http://localhost:3000/index
```

The response to the POST is a JSON object with the following values:
| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `access_token` | The access token for the protected resource |
| `token_type` | `bearer` |
| `expires_in` | The seconds until expiration (`3600`)

The `access_token` is valid for 1 hour and can be used to query protected resources from the CPCDS Server. For more details on how to use the CPCDS Server view the [README](https://github.com/carin-alliance/cpcds-server-ri).

## JWT Token Structure

JWT tokens are used throughout this process to digitally sign the Authorization Code and the Access Token. All JWT tokens in this reference implementation utilize the HS256 algorithm. The structure of the payload for the two types of tokens are shown below:

### Authorization Code Payload Structure

```json
{
  "aud": "http://localhost:8180", // Audience is the this auth server
  "client_username": "user689", // The login username for this client
  "iss": "http://localhost:8180", // Issued by this auth server URL
  "redirect_uri": "http://localhost:4000/client", // redirect_uri param from request
  "exp": 1583853744, // Time of expiration (120s after iat)
  "iat": 1583853624 // Issued at time
}
```

### Access Token Payload Structure

```json
{
  "aud": "http://localhost:8080/cpcds-server/fhir", // Audience is the protected CPCDS server
  "iss": "http://localhost:8180", // Issued by this auth server URL
  "exp": 1583856862, // Time of expiration (3600s after iat)
  "iat": 1583853262, // Issued at time
  "client_id": "1" // Patient ID for this client
}
```

## Configuration

There are a few pieces which must be configured on this server.

The first is the shared secret between this server and the Auth server. By default the secret is simply "secret", but a stronger secret should be used in practice. This can be configured by setting the `jwt.secret` enviornment variable

```bash
export jwtsecret="new secret"
```

The auth server must know the EHR Server endpoint to validate the audience. This can be configured in `App.java` by changing the value of `ehrServer`.
